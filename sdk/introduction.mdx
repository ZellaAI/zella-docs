<Note>
Pro Tip: To facilitate a smooth transition to Zella with minimal modifications to your current setup 
we’ve incorporated compatibility with OpenAI’s request/response structure in the Zella Gateway.
This means you can seamlessly integrate with Zella while continuing to use any sdk(eg. OpenAI, Langchain) which follows
OpenAI request/response schemas.
