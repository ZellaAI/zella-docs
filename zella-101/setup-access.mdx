## Create a new workspace
Create a new workspace in [Zella Dashboard](https://zella.ai/dashboard), give your workspace a name and invite your team members to your newly created workspace.

## Setup platform to use
Select a platform to start with(you can add multiple platforms to use once the dashboard is setup). Store your platform key with us safely.
<Note>
  Storing the keys with us is an optional step but not doing so will limit you from a variety of features like model configurations, token load balancing etc.
</Note>
