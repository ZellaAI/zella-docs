## Create a new workspace
Create a new workspace in [Zella Dashboard](https://zella.ai/dashboard), name your workspace and invite your team members to your newly created workspace.

## Setup platform to use
Choose your first platform! You can add more later from the Zella Dashboard. Trust us to securely store your platform key.
<Note>
  Storing your keys unlocks advanced features like model configurations, token load balancing, and more! It's optional, but highly recommended for a better Zella experience.
