## Introduction

Datasets in Zella provide a structured approach for users to organize and manage input-output
pairs for various AI tasks. This section of the documentation aims to guide users on creating,
managing, and utilizing datasets effectively within the Zella platform.

## Creating Datasets

Users can create datasets within the Zella dashboard, structured with input, output, and
result (Boolean) fields. They can either manually input data, upload CSV files adhering to
the specified format, or leverage the Request Logs feature to populate datasets with existing
responses from their models. This Request Logs functionality provides users with access to
historical model responses, facilitating the incorporation of real-world data into their
datasets seamlessly.

### Uploading CSV Files

Streamlining data input, Zella allows users to upload CSV files directly into the platform.
Upon upload, Zella processes the file, extracting relevant data fields and populating the
dataset accordingly.

### Request Logs Integration

Users can effortlessly enrich their datasets within the Zella dashboard by leveraging the
Request Logs feature. This functionality grants access to historical model responses,
facilitating seamless integration of real-world data into datasets.

## Utilizing Datasets

Datasets are integral to various functionalities within Zella:

1. Jobs: Users can specify datasets as input during job execution, enabling comprehensive analysis
   and evaluation by the AI model.
2. Few-Shot LLM Evaluators: Datasets serve as foundational components for Few-Shot LLM evaluators,
   aiding in assessing AI model performance based on provided prompts and input-output pairs.

## Conclusion

The addition of datasets in Zella enhances the platform's capabilities, providing users with
a structured approach to organize and manage input-output pairs for AI tasks. Through the creation,
uploading, and utilization of datasets, users can streamline their workflow, enabling efficient
execution of jobs and evaluation of AI models. This documentation provides comprehensive guidance
on leveraging datasets within the Zella platform, empowering users to maximize the potential
of their AI projects.
