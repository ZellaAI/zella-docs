## Primary and Fallback Models Explained
Each Zella Model features a primary model, which is your first point of contact for every request.
If the primary model encounters issues, perhaps due to its platform, Zella automatically tries your
request with the fallback models, in the order you've set them up. This approach ensures your AI
solutions are both reliable and tailored to your specific needs.

## Customizable Retry Options
With Zella, you have the flexibility to set the number of retries for both your primary and fallback models.
If a platform hiccup occurs, Zella will attempt retries as configured before switching to the next
fallback model.

## Personalized Settings
Zella Models put you in the driver's seat. Customize model-level configurations for each of your
primary and fallback models, ensuring the AI performs exactly as you require.

## Effortless Access
Once your Zella Model is set up, you can access it using its unique identifier. This makes integrating
it into your projects as straightforward as using any standard model in the Zella Gateway.

## In Conclusion
Zella Models are designed to simplify and personalize your AI experience. They are ideal for anyone
seeking to leverage AI's power without the complexities of navigating multiple tools and platforms.
