description: "Streamline your experimentation process with Zella AI's three-step 
approach to creating experiments for optimized AI configurations."

Creating an experiment in Zella AI is a structured process designed to guide you through
the exploration and optimization of your AI configurations. Follow the three-step process
outlined below to create your experiment effectively.

## Create Experiment Page

Head to `Zella AI -> Dashboard -> Analysis -> A/B Testings -> Create Experiment` and select which experiment
type you want to create. (model or prompt)

The first step in creating an experiment is to provide essential details such as the name
and description of the experiment. Additionally, you'll need to select the configured Zella
router or prompt on which you want to conduct the experiment. This initial setup lays the
foundation for your experimentation journey, enabling you to define the scope and objectives of your experiment accurately.

## Select Experiment Variations

Once you've set up the experiment, it's time to select the variations that you want to explore
for the selected Zella router or prompt. Here, you can choose from existing variations or create
new ones as needed. It's essential to select at least two variations to run the experiment effectively.
This step allows you to introduce diversity into your experiment, facilitating comparative analysis and informed decision-making.

## Enter Configuration Page

In the final step of creating your experiment, you'll enter the configuration details
to fine-tune the experiment parameters. Specify the traffic percentage for each selected
variation, indicating the proportion of requests allocated to each variation during the
experiment. Additionally, define the start and end times of the experiment, or choose to
start it manually. You can also set the "isUserSticky" parameter, which determines whether
multiple requests from the same user will be answered using the same variation, enhancing
consistency and accuracy in your experimentation process.

By following these three steps, you can create experiments in Zella AI with ease, empowering
you to explore, analyze, and optimize your AI configurations effectively. Start your experimentation
journey today and unlock the full potential of your AI applications.
