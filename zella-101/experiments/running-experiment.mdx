## Experiment Details

The Experiment Details page serves as your central hub for managing and monitoring your experiments.
It comprises seven tabs, each providing valuable insights and functionality to enhance your
experimentation process. These tabs include Summary, Variation Management, Results, Analytics,
Configurations, Message Logs, and Request Logs, all tailored to provide comprehensive information
and analytics for the ongoing experiment.

## User Control

Users with appropriate permissions have the ability to manage experiments manually, allowing them
to run, pause, or end experiments as needed. This control enables users to intervene in the
experimentation process, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness in managing AI configurations.

## Note

Under experimentation, Zella AI intelligently selects the variant based on the ongoing experiment's
parameters, ensuring seamless integration and testing. Even if a user specifies a variation identifier
for the model/prompt in their requests, Zella AI will override it and select the variant according
to the experiment. This ensures that experiments are conducted accurately and consistently, facilitating
reliable results and informed decision-making.
