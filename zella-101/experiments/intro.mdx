## What are Experiments?

Experiments in Zella AI are systematic tests that enable developers to explore
different variations of routers and prompts to achieve desired outcomes.
They provide a structured approach for assessing performance and making data-driven decisions.

Experiments encompass a range of activities, from testing individual model configurations
to evaluating diverse prompt structures. By conducting experiments,
developers can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of different setups and refine their AI applications accordingly.

## How Experiments Work?

In Zella AI, experiments empower developers by facilitating the execution of A/B tests,
real-time result analysis, and the discovery of optimal configurations tailored to specific user needs.
By running experiments, developers can systematically compare the performance of different router and prompt variations,
gaining insights into which configurations yield the best results.
This iterative process allows developers to fine-tune their AI applications, enhancing overall performance and user experience.

## Creating Experiments

Creating experiments in Zella AI is a straightforward process designed to empower developers to
explore new possibilities and drive innovation. To create an experiment, simply select the prompt
or model whose variations you want to explore, choose the variations to include in the experiment,
and define the traffic allocation for each variation.

It's important to note that you can make changes to your experiment configuration only when the
experiment is in a draft or inactive state. Once the experiment is active, you can monitor its
progress and performance in real-time, enabling you to make data-driven decisions and optimize your AI applications effectively.
