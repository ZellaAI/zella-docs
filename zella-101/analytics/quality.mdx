## Quality Analytics Screen:

The Quality Analytics Screen within the Zella AI workspace offers comprehensive statistics and insights about
messages in the context of evaluators generated by API requests or jobs. This screen provides users with
valuable information to assess the quality of AI model performance and optimize workflows accordingly.

### Aggregate Statistics:

1. **Pass Rate**: The percentage of messages that passed the evaluation criteria.
2. **Pass Rates by Evaluators**: Breakdown of pass rates by different evaluators.
3. **Total Messages**: The total number of messages within the workspace.
4. **Total Inferences**: The total number of inferences made by the AI models.
5. **Total Tokens**: The cumulative count of tokens across all messages.
6. **Total Latency**: The total latency, or processing time, of all inferences.

### Charts:

1. **Pass Percentage**: An area graph plotting pass percentage over time.
2. **Inference**: A pie chart displaying the distribution of inferences by different evaluators.
3. **Total Inference**: A bar graph illustrating the total number of inferences over time.
4. **Cost of Inference**: A bar graph showing the cost of inference over time.
5. **Total Tokens**: A bar graph representing the total number of tokens over time.

### Message Table:

A table presents detailed information about each message sent using the gateway or generated from jobs within
the workspace. Clicking on any message within the table opens a detailed panel, providing a closer look at
the message. This panel offers comprehensive insights into the message content, facilitating deeper analysis
and troubleshooting.

The Quality Analytics Screen empowers users to assess AI model performance, track evaluation metrics, and
make informed decisions to enhance the overall quality of AI-driven workflows within the Zella AI workspace.
