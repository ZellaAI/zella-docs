## Creating and Testing Prompt Variations
With Zella, you can craft multiple versions of a prompt, easily toggling between them by designating
a default variant. This feature is particularly useful for A/B testing, allowing you to experiment
and determine the most effective prompt variant for your needs.

## Utilizing Context Variables
Zella Prompts are versatile, thanks to their support for context variables. You can embed variables
directly in your prompts using the {"{{variable_name}}"} syntax and supply the corresponding values in
your requests. This flexibility makes the prompts adaptable for various use cases.

## Effortless Retrieval and Experimentation
After setting up your Zella Prompt, you can access it using its unique prompt identifier in the Zella
Gateway requests. When making a request, if a specific variant identifier is provided, that variant
is used; otherwise, the default variant is selected. For prompts under experimentation, Zella
intelligently chooses the variant based on the ongoing experiment's parameters, ensuring seamless
integration and testing.

In summary, Zella Prompts are about enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of your AI prompt
management, making them an invaluable tool for anyone seeking to optimize their use of AI prompts
with minimal hassle.
